# Getting started

`upctl` provides a command-line interface to [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/) services. It allows you
to control your resources from the command line or any compatible interface.

## Install upctl

`upctl` can be installed from a pre-built package in the repositories [GitHub releases](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli/releases),
using a package manager, Docker image, or from sources with `go install`:

=== "Linux"

    Download pre-built package from GitHub releases and install it with your package manager.

    On Ubuntu or Debian, use the `.deb` package.

    ```sh
    curl -Lo upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_amd64.deb https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli/releases/download/v{{ latest_release }}/upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_amd64.deb
    # Preferably verify the asset before proceeding with install, see "Verify assets" below
    sudo apt install ./upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_amd64.deb
    ```

    On RHEL based distributions, use the `.rpm` package.

    ```sh
    curl -Lo upcloud-cli-{{ latest_release }}-1.x86_64.rpm https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli/releases/download/v{{ latest_release }}/upcloud-cli-{{ latest_release }}-1.x86_64.rpm
    # Preferably verify the asset before proceeding with install, see "Verify assets" below
    sudo dnf install ./upcloud-cli-{{ latest_release }}-1.x86_64.rpm
    ```

=== "macOS"

    Use homebrew to install `upctl` from [UpCloudLtd tap](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/homebrew-tap).

    ```sh
    brew tap UpCloudLtd/tap
    brew install upcloud-cli
    ```

=== "Windows"

    First, download the archived binary from GitHub releases to current folder and extract the binary from the archive.

    ```pwsh
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli/releases/download/v{{ latest_release }}/upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_windows_x86_64.zip" -OutFile "upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_windows_x86_64.zip"
    # Preferably verify the asset before proceeding with install, see "Verify assets" below
    Expand-Archive -Path "upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_windows_x86_64.zip"

    # Print current location
    Get-Location
    ```

    Then, close the current PowerShell session and open a new session as an administrator. Move the binary to `upcloud-cli` folder in _Program Files_, add the `upcloud-cli` folder in _Program Files_ to `Path`.

    ```pwsh
    # Open the PowerShell with Run as Administrator option.
    # Use Set-Location to change into folder that you used in previous step.

    New-Item -ItemType Directory $env:ProgramFiles\upcloud-cli\ -Force
    Move-Item -Path upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_windows_x86_64\upctl.exe -Destination $env:ProgramFiles\upcloud-cli\ -Force

    # Setting the Path is required only on first install.
    # Thus, this step can be skipped when updating to a more recent version.
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine) + ";$env:ProgramFiles\upcloud-cli\", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
    ```

    After running the above commands, close the administrator PowerShell session and open a new PowerShell session to verify installation succeeded.

=== "`go install`"

    Install the latest version of `upctl` with `go install`, by running:

    ```sh
    go install github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli/v3/...@latest
    ```

=== "Docker"

    Pull the latest build from GHCR by running:

    ```sh
    docker pull ghcr.io/upcloudltd/upctl:latest
    ```

=== "mise"

    Install with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev):

    ```sh
    mise use upctl  # or with -g for global
    ```

=== "aqua"

    Install with [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io), `aqua.yaml` example:

    ```yaml
    registries:
    - type: standard
    packages:
    - name: UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli@{{ latest_release }}
    ```

---

After installing `upctl`, you can run `upctl version` command to verify that the tool was installed successfully.

```sh
upctl version
```

### SBOMs

[SPDX SBOM](https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/) documents (`*.spdx.json`) are available alongside release archives.

### Verify assets

[GitHub artifact attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations)
and plain old checksum files are available for verifying release assets.

=== "Attestations"

    [Release asset artifact attestations](https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli/attestations)
    can be verified for example with the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli),
    using the Linux x86_64 asset as an example:

    ```sh
    gh attestation verify \
        /path/to/locally/downloaded/upcloud-cli_{{ latest_release }}_linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
        --repo UpCloudLtd/upcloud-cli
    ```

    Attestations are available starting from version 3.16.0.

=== "Digests"

    Release assets' SHA-256 digests are available in releases,
    in asset named `checksums.txt`. They can be checked for example with:

    ```sh
    # make sure at least one downloaded asset and checksums.txt are in the current directory
    sha256sum -c --ignore-missing checksums.txt
    ```

### Configure shell completions

`upctl` provides shell completions for multiple shells. Run `upctl completion --help` to list the supported shells.

```sh
upctl completion --help
```

To configure the shell completions, follow the instructions provided in the help output of the command matching the shell you are using. For example, if you are using zsh, run `upctl completion zsh --help` to print the configuration instructions.

#### Bash completions

On bash, the completions depend on `bash-completion` package. Install and configure the package according to your OS:

=== "Linux"

    First, install `bash-completion` package, if it has not been installed already.

    On Ubuntu or Debian, use `apt` command to install the package:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install bash-completion
    ```

    On RHEL and Fedora based distributions, use `dnf` command to install the package.

    ```sh
    sudo dnf install bash-completion
    ```

    Most distributions' packages enable bash-completion automatically.
    If not, something like this can be done to accomplish that:

    ```sh
    printf "%s\n" "[[ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash-completion ]] && . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash-completion" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    If your bash-completion version is 2.12 or newer, no further steps are needed,
    upctl completion will load automatically on demand. With older bash-completion versions,
    the autoloading needs to be set up. Something like this will accomplish that:

    ```sh
    # Either system wide:
    printf "%s\n" 'eval -- "$("$1" completion bash 2>/dev/null)"' > /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/upctl

    # ...or per user:
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
    printf "%s\n" 'eval -- "$("$1" completion bash 2>/dev/null)"' > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/upctl
    ```

=== "macOS"

    First, install `bash-completion` package, if it has not been installed already, and add command to source the completions to your `.bash_profile`.

    ```sh
    brew install bash-completion
    echo '[ -f "$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion" ] && . "$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    Then configure the shell completions for `upctl` by saving the output of `upctl completion bash` in `upctl` file under `/etc/bash_completion.d/`:

    ```sh
    upctl completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/upctl
    . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
    ```

## Configure credentials

To be able to manage your UpCloud resources, you need to configure credentials for `upctl` and enable API access for these credentials.

Define the credentials by setting `UPCLOUD_USERNAME` and `UPCLOUD_PASSWORD` environment variables.

API access can be configured in the UpCloud Hub on [Account page](https://hub.upcloud.com/account/overview) for the main-account and on the [Permissions tab](https://hub.upcloud.com/people/permissions) of the People page for sub-accounts. We recommend you to set up a sub-account specifically for the API usage with its own username and password, as it allows you to assign specific permissions for increased security.

## Execute commands

To verify you are able to access the UpCloud API, you can, for example, run `upctl account show` command to print your current balance and resource limits.

```sh
upctl account show
```

For usage examples, see the _Examples_ section of the documentation.

For reference on how to use each sub-command, see the _Commands reference_ section of the documentation. The same information is also available in `--help` output of each command.
